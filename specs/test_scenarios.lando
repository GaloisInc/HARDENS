// Scenarios are sequences of events.  Scenarios document normal and abnormal
// traces of system execution.

// Test scenarios are scenarios that validate a system conforms to its
// requirements through runtime verification (testing).  Each scenario
// is refined to a (possibly parametrized) runtime verification
// property.  If a testbench is complete, then every path of a
// system's state machine should be covered by the its set of scenarios.
