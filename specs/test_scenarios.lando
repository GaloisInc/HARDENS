// Scenarios are sequences of events.  Scenarios document normal and abnormal
// traces of system execution.

// Test scenarios are scenarios that validate a system conforms to its
// requirements through runtime verification (testing).  Each scenario
// is refined to a (possibly parametrized) runtime verification
// property.  If a testbench is complete, then every path of a
// system's state machine should be covered by the its set of scenarios.

// Exceptional behaviors are *predictable* system behaviors triggered
// by external environment affects.  Examples include a CPU, OS,
// device, or network total or partial failure.  E.g., CPU deadlock,
// out-of-memory errors, permanent store partial and total failures,
// lack of space in permanent store, partial and total network
// failures, device driver partial or total failures, etc.

// In our architecture, every part of the RTS system, and particularly
// every part of the intrumentation and sensing subsystem and every
// part of the actuation subsystem must be able to fail and the sysetm
// must respond appropriately.
