## Project Overview

The goal of HARDENS is to provide to the NRC expert technical services
in order to (1) develop a better understanding of how Model-Based
Systems Engineering (MBSE) methods and tools can support regulatory
reviews of adequate design and design assurance, and (2) identify any
barriers or gaps associated with MBSE in a regulatory review of
Digital Instrumentation and Control Systems for existing Nuclear Power
Plants (NPPs).

In the HARDENS project Galois will demonstrate to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) cutting- edge capabilities in the
model-based design, validation, and verification of safety-critical,
mission-critical, high-assurance systems. Our demonstrator includes
high-assurance software and hardware, includes open source RISC-V
Central Processing Units (CPUs), and lays the groundwork for a
high-assurance reusable product for safety critical Digital
Instrumentation and Control Systems systems in NPPs.

Details about the HARDENS project are found in our 
[original proposal](docs/HARDENS.pdf), which was written in response 
to the [original NRC RFP](docs/RFP.pdf).

This document summarizes the current state of affairs of the project
and demonstrator.

## Executive Summary

In the **High Assurance Rigorous Digital Engineering for Nuclear
Safety** (HARDENS) project, Galois has developed a high-assurance,
safety-critical demonstration system for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission using Rigorous Digital Engineering (RDE).  The system in
question is a Digital Instrumentation and Control (DI&C) system for
Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), and is called the Reactor Trip System
(RTS).

RDE is the combination of *Model-based Engineering*, *Digital
Engineering*, and *Applied Formal Methods*.  The engineering focus of
RDE is broad, as we have used it to perform *software, firmware,
hardware, systems, domain, requirements, product line, safety, and
security engineering* of *high-assurance, secure-by-design systems*.
The HARDENS project includes nearly all of these kinds of engineering,
but for security engineering at this time.

To our knowledge, this demonstrator is the most rigorously specified
and assured system of its kind that includes formally assured software
and hardware for a safety-critical system.

*Model-based Engineering* focuses on the use of semi-formal and formal
models and their properties to describe aspects of a system
independent of a particular implementation.  Models are connected to
each other through a variety of relations (refinement, containment,
subtyping/subsumption/implication, traceability, etc.), models are
either or both denotational or operational (and thus executable), and
models are used to specify, examine, understand, and reason about a
system well-prior to a line of code ever being written.  Models are
used for rigorous validation---through automatic model-based test
bench generation and bisimulation---and formal verification---through
automatic model-based verification bench generation.

The models used in HARDENS include, from most to least abstract:
 - a Lando high-level system specification model, which includes
   within it:
   + a domain engineering model, 
   + a requirements engineering model, which includes:
     * derived certification requirements,
     * contractual requirements,
     * safety requirements, and
     * correctness requirements.
   + a product line (feature) model, 
   + a static system model, 
   + a dataflow model of the RDE methodology, 
   + a system event model, 
   + a system scenario model (including all normal and exceptional
     behaviors),
   + a hardware, software, and evidence Bill of Materials (BOMs), 
 - a SysMLv2 system model, which includes within it, as refined
   directly from the Lando model:
   + a stakeholder model,
   + a domain engineering model,
   + a requirements engineering model,
   + property specifications for all correctness and safety properties
     derived from the formal requirements model,
   + a product line (feature/variant) model,
   + a static system model that includes both the software and
     hardware manifestations of the system,
   + a system action model, and
   + a validation and verification assurance case model.
 - a formal requirements model expressed in JPL's FRET tool, as
   refined from the Lando and SysMLv2 requirements models above,
 - a Cryptol model of the entire system, including all subsystems and
   components, including formal, executable digital twin models of the
   system's sensors, actuators, and compute infrastructure, and this
   Cryptol model includes a refinement of all formal requirements from
   FRET into Cryptol properties (theorems) about the Cryptol model
   itself,
 - a model of the semantics of the RISC-V instruction set,
 - a model-based specification of critical portions of the RTS's
   software stack expressed in ACSL,
 - an executable and synthesizable Bluespec System Verilog model of a
   family of RISC-V-based SoCs, and
 - a System Verilog executable and synthesizable model of a simple,
   in-order 32-bit RISC-V CPU (NERV, from YosysHQ).

Digital Engineering focuses on the use of *digital twins* of physical
systems, subsystems, and their components.  A digital twin is
typically an executable model that has known and measurable objective
fidelity in relation to the models or systems that relate to the twin.
For example, an executable Cryptol or SCADE model are a digital twins.

The HARDENS system includes several digital twins, including
simulation and emulation of the system hardware (CPUs and SoCs),
software implementation, and system model.

Applied formal methods are the sensible use of formal methods
concepts, tools, and technologies to formally specifying and reasoning
about systems and their properties.  In the context of RDE and the
HARDENS project, we use formal methods to achieve the following
assurance:
 - critical components of the RTS are automatically synthesized from
   Cryptol model into both formally verifiable C implementations and
   formally verifiable System Verilog implementations,
 - automatically generated C code and hand-written implementations of
   the same models are used to fulfill safety-critical redundancy and
   fault-tolerance requirements, and all of those implementations are
   formally verified both against their model, as well as verified
   against each other as being equivalent, using Frama-C and Galois's
   SAW tool,
 - the RISC-V CPU is formally verified against the RISC-V ISA
   specification using the Yosys open source verification tool,
 - the RISC-V-based SoC is rigorously assured against the
   automatically generated end-to-end test bench,
 - the formal requirements specified in FRET are formally verified for
   consistency, completeness, and realizability using SAT and SMT
   solvers,
 - the refinement of these requirements into Cryptol properties are
   used as model validation theorems to rigorously check and formally
   verifying that the Cryptol model conforms to the requirements,
 - the Cryptol model is used to automatically generate a component-level
   and end-to-end test bench (in C) for the entire system, and that
   test bench is executed on all digital twins and (soon) the full
   hardware implementation as well, and
 - all models and assurance artifacts are traceable and sit in a
   semi-formal refinement hierarchy that spans semi-formal system
   specification written in precise natural language all of the way
   down for formally assured source code (in verifiable C), (a
   side-effect of the optional use of CompCert) binaries, and hardware
   designs (in System Verilog and Bluespec System Verilog).

## Task 1: Implementation

As described in our proposal and the project Statement of Work, in
Task 1 (Implementation), the first task of the HARDENS project, Galois
will implement the system described above using both (1) highly
integrated computer-based engineering development processes and (2)
model-based systems engineering.  All the modules of the simple
protection system will be modeled functionally, and one FPGA-based
circuit card will be modeled/designed in detail. The deliverable will
be the model-based design itself. We will use Galoisâ€™s RDE process and
methodology to achieve this goal, as well as the V&V in Task 2.

All project models---the SysMLv2 model, the executable, rigorously
validated and formally verified Cryptol model, and the semi-formal and
formal requirements model---are included in this release and are found
in the `develop` branch of the repository.

Also, the initial implementation of the system which runs as an
application on a POSIX host (e.g., a Linux or macOS development
machine or in the HARDENS Docker image) is found in the
as-of-yet-unmerged `c-impl` branch in the HARDENS repository.  That
implementation includes both hand-written C code conforming to the
model-based specifications discussed above, as well as automatically
synthesized formally verified sub-components, as described in the
HARDENS proposal, for a small handful of critical sub-components.
These synthesized components are generated in formally verified C
source code and in the System Verilog HDL. The POSIX-based simulation 
can execute both the generated C components and the generated System Verilog
components by means of a shim library wrapping the Verilated components.

Finally, we have a formally verified RISC-V CPU, called the `nerv`
CPU, built and tested on the ECP5-5G board.  We have sketched out
an initial three core SoC design using Bluespec SystemVerilog, but
have not yet built that SoC for emulation or put it on the FGPA.  We
will accomplish such early in Task 2, and cross-compile our POSIX C
implementation to that SoC.  That ongoing work is found in the `nerv`
branch of the repository.

## Task 2: Validation and Verification

As described in the Statement of Work, for Task 2 of the HARDENS project Galois
will perform preliminary validation and verification and testing of the design 
using model-based engineering and testing methods. The deliverable will be the 
artifacts as described in the proposal.

The [Hardens Assurance Case](./Assurance.md) document in this repository describes
the end-to-end specification-to-implementation process, system requirements, testing, 
and V&V associated with Task 2 deliverables. Rather than restate the document's contents 
here, Galois recommends reviewing it as a conextualized summary of Task 2 artifacts.

Galois will continue to develop V&V capabilities and port the design to actual hardware
in preparation for Tasks 3 (Evaluation) and 4 (Presentation).

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- [specs](./specs) contains a domain model (`*.lando`, `*.lobot`), requirements
  (exported from `FRET` to `RTS_requirements.json`), and a specification of the RTS architecture
  (`*.sysml`).
- [models](./models) contains the executable Cryptol model
- [assets](./assets) and [docs](./docs) contain project and device documentation
- [saw](./saw) contains SAW-based proofs of correctness of specific model-derived
  components
- [tests](./tests) contains end-to-end tests derived from the lando test scenarios.

## Submodules

This repository does not currently use any submodules.  If/when it
does, initialize with:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update --recursive
```

## Docker

A Docker container has been built to make for easier use, evaluation,
reusability, and repeatibility of project results.  We are adding
tools to this container as necessary during project execution.

### HARDENS Container

To build and run the core HARDENS Docker image, use the `build_docker.sh` script and then
`docker run` commands.

```
$ ./build_docker.sh
$ docker run --network host --privileged -v $PWD:/HARDENS -it hardens:latest
```

In order to run a long-lived Docker container for reuse, use a `docker
run` command like the following, ensuring that you are in the right
directory in order to bind your sandbox properly into the container.

```
$ docker run -d -it --name HARDENS --network host --privileged -v $PWD:/HARDENS hardens:latest
```

After running such a detacted container, attach to it for interactive
use by running a command like:
```
$ docker exec -it HARDENS bash -l
```

If you are *within Galois network*, you can download the docker image from artifactory:

```bash
$ docker pull artifactory.galois.com:5015/hardens:latest
$ docker run --network host --privileged -v $PWD:/HARDENS -it artifactory.galois.com:5015/hardens:latest
```


### SysMLv2 Container

To pull and use the pre-build SysMLv2 container, use the following
`pull` command to pull the container from DockerHub.  See
https://hub.docker.com/r/gorenje/sysmlv2-jupyter for details.

```
$ docker pull gorenje/sysmlv2-jupyter:latest
$ docker run -d -it --name SysMLv2 --network host -v $PWD:/HARDENS gorenje/sysmlv2-jupyter:latest
```
