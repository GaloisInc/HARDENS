** The HARDENS Project

*** framing: RDE
*** how we tackled the problem
*** deliverables

** Model Based Engineering (in the general)
- classical engineering and what it looks like, even today in 2022
- relationship between MBE and other core branches of engineering
  (requirements, systems, software, hardware, safety) and "alt"
  branches of engineering (domain, requirements, security, firmware,
  reverse, product line, etc.)
- commercial MBE and what it generally looks like
- successes in commercial MBE, both for general subsystems and for
- high-assurance systems engineering

* Model-Based Engineering Technologies, Challenges, and Solutions

** most salient MBE technologies that the NRC should be aware of, and
  our frank reflections on their utility/impact
 - requirements engineering (Mathworks Requirements Toolbox, DOORS,
 - FRET, etc.)
 - UI/UX frameworks
 - database frameworks
 - systems engineering languages and tools (particularly SysML, AADL, and UML)
 - DSLs (particularly SCADE, MATLAB, Simulink, Stateflow)
 - the semi-sorry state of hardware MBE
 - the power of model lifting and its absence from commercial tooling
 - Collins Aerospace work, Resolute, NASA Advocate tool, etc. (DESTION 2021)
 - Developing Assurance Cases for D-MILS Systems

** MBE Modeling Platform, Tools, and Languages
*** Galois Framing
- The RDE Research Program
- Models and Reasoning at Galois
*** Commodity Technologies of MBE
**** Containers, VMs, etc.
**** Modeling Environments (IBM, Dassault, etc.)
**** IDEs
**** (E)DSLs
**** UML, AADL, and SysML
*** Advanced Technologies of MBE
**** Structural Specifications
**** Behavioral Specifiations
**** Security Specifications
*** the state-of-the-art in MBE in 2022 outside of the mainstream commercial realm
- DSLs and DSAs
- model-lifting and reasoning
 - code generation and reasoning
 - model-based runtime verification/testing
 - BISLs and model-based software engineering
 - HLS/UVM/SVA and model-based hardware engineering
*** gaps in commercial tooling vs. need
 - model-code correspondence (artifacts and properties)
 - the HLS butterfly effect
 - code generation that ignores non-behavioral facets (human
   comprehensibility, assurance, performance)
 - traceability
 - ambiguities in natural language
 - models without semantics
 - many MBE graphical languages have no textual syntax
 - ignore the full life cycle, esp. process, methodology, and maintenance
 - no integration with popular and powerful IDEs
 - no connection with applied formal methods
 - no support for product line engineering
 - little connection with authentic security engineering (SA-EDI example)

** Challenge Problems in Safety-Critical Systems
*** what constitutes sufficient evidence
- What are the criteria for determining the independently verifiable
evidence needed to meet the safety claim (reactor protection), i.e,
the safety requirements/constraints are validated and verified?
- What evidence would suffice?
- How do you evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence?
- Does the state of the art in evidence production and evaluation
provide the needed support?
*** evidence necessary to eliminate design diversity
- What independently verifiable evidence would suffice for eliminating
the need for “design diversity” yielding at least the same level of
assurance (as obtained with diverse designs) that the safety function
of a safety system such as RPS (reactor protection system) will be
performed when needed.
*** no worse than
- What logically correct reasoning could demonstrate that the evidence
supports the conclusion (i.e., the safety function will be performed
when needed) with the residual uncertainty lower than or comparable to
the uncertainty associated with a design incorporating “design
diversity”.
*** independently verifiable evidence
- What independently verifiable evidence would suffice to demonstrate
that the same deficiencies are not present in the diverse designs OR,
if present, would not degrade the performance of the safety function.
*** uncertainties degrade
- What independently verifiable evidence would indicate that there is a
significant potential for degrading the safety function of systems
such as RPS due to a combined effect of the uncertainties from V&V of
development phase work products.
- What verifiable evidence would suffice to claim that the residual
uncertainties will not degrade the performance of the safety function.
*** practitioner competance in hazard modification
- What independently verifiable evidence would suffice to claim that
the practitioner has the competence to identify all significant
hazards (i.e., conditions which could degrade the performance of the
safety function of RPS) which are rooted in engineering deficiencies,
especially hazards caused by interactions.
*** compliance with standards
- What independently verifiable evidence is needed to justify
non-compliance with over-constraints (or prescriptive content) in
standards (e.g., IEEE standards).
*** evaluating adequacy without design diversity
- How do you evaluate the adequacy of an approach without design diversity?
*** requirements vs. design diversity
- If diverse designs are based on the same requirements, does that
common cause defeat design diversity?
- How do you validate the requirements incl. the flow-down (derivation,
decomposition, allocation), incl. emergent behavior?
*** integrating disparate evidence
- With different types of evidence, how do you evaluate the integrated
effect on the safety claim?
- What is the state of the art in demonstrating a safety claim,
reasoning from science-based evidence?

** how to engineers develop skills
** how might the NRC use SMEs
** Secret Ninja Formal Methods
** the state-of-the-art in FPGA-based systems engineering
** non-interference
- What is the start-of-the-art in specifying that interacting components
of a system will not degrade each other’s performance, e.g., not cause
unspecified behavior?
** verification
- What is the state-of-the-art in verifying that such a specification
has been satisfied?

=====

 If you have a bit more time, I’d be interested in a quick take on
 mentioning “sneaky ninja formal methods.”  You’ve mentioned them in
 your presentations, and your papers are more oriented towards
 educational uses.  However the “automated theorem proving, static
 code analysis, runtime assertion generation, and other processes
 underlying the system” would seem to also be of use to reviews as
 they could evaluate the structured English portions and, with some
 research and guidance, perhaps trust the results for specific tools
 from there.


 Derek: EPRI is also making some efforts with formal methods in the
 SymPle project.  However that’s meant to be proprietary, and even
 their reports on it, while publicly available, cost $40,000.  Still
 it’s hoped HARDENS will help prepare for potential future reviews in
 this area.

 Sushil: The meeting with EPRI covered all the future research
 projects on both sides. EPRI was satisfied (rather than alarmed) with
 our direction (MBSE; AC). I will draft a graphic depicting how these
 concepts could enter the nuclear industry - the enabling
 organizations, funding sources, and champions. Then we can discuss
 Galois’ role.
